LibriVox uses a Gerrit-based workflow on
[GerritHub](https://review.gerrithub.io/). To propose a contribution, clone the
repo, hack away, then submit for review:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LibriVox/librivox-catalog.git
$ git commit
$ git review
```

There are many issues, unfortunately most of them are not tracked publicly and
are hidden away in random Google Docs. Converting them to GitHub issues should
really be Issue 0.
