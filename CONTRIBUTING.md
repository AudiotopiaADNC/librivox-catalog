LibriVox uses a Gerrit-based workflow on
[GerritHub](https://review.gerrithub.io/). To propose a contribution, clone the
repo, hack away, then submit for review:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LibriVox/librivox-catalog.git
$ git commit
$ git review
```

Issues are currently listed ("tracked" would be too generous) in a [Google
doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1LTMEmwxH1vKLwNXN4U3wop69ElWFjnmqWyV5Jxbl9qc/). Converting these to GitHub issues should be issue #0.
